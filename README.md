# The SaaS CTO Security Checklist

The content of this checklist is now deprecated. If you want to read the updated version check [https://www.sqreen.com/checklists/saas-cto-security-checklist](https://www.sqreen.com/checklists/saas-cto-security-checklist)

This is a basic checklist that all SaaS CTOs (and anyone else) can use to harden their security. Security shouldn’t feel like a chore. Select your startup stage and use these rules to improve your security. This list is far from exhaustive, incomplete by nature since the security you need depends on your assets.
